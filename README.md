## Introduction: Joe tries day trading
Joe keeps hearing the same advice on r/WSB: “You should be like Warren Buffett, and ‘BTFD’!” and “Buy when there’s blood on the streets!” After learning in Project #1 that he’ll never be able to afford a house doing passive investments he’s decided to try his hand at making money in speculative trading! Joe wanted to use his newly acquired fintech skills to help him with where to look for cheap stocks! Joe will use NLP to analyze sentiment and narrow down a list of candidate stocks. After which Joe will run a technical analysis of the the stock and lastly Joe wants to use a classification model that will help him predict if the stock price will go up or down the next day. This way Joe can rely on various techy tools instead of only relying on gossip or news articles recomending what he should invest in.

## **Joe's approach**
Joe wanted up to date fresh news to find what stocks are being most talked about negatively. Unfortunately, Joe finds traditional media too unreliable! Instead, Joe decided to use Twitter. Thinking the info would arrive much quicker than news articles! Giving him some sort of edge over the "average Joe". Joe strictly means business and so he decided to look through the tweets of some big name traders only. Having fresh tweets by traders on what stocks they were talking about, Joe started his NLP analysis and narrow down a list of "beaten" stocks. Then he used technical analys and a self made decision tree to further identify if the stock will bounce back and make him money!  


## **Conclusion**
Joe was able to identify a few 'beat down' stocks from Twitter based on sentiment analysis. OLLI was considered the best option available among them. Joe has ran the stock pick through his checks and both the TA analysis & decision tree model give him the green light on investing! Unfortunately, his Decision Tree model needs some fine tuning as it was not great at predicting daily returns. 
=======
Joe was able to idenify the top 5 most beat down stocks from twitter. OLLI was evaluated as the best option availabe. Joe has ran the stock pick through his checks and both the TA analysis & decision tree model give him the green  light on invesrting! All Joe has to do now is sit on his hands and hopefully in six months Joe will have more money towards buying a home! (hes still sour from the first project)
