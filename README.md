## Summary
Joe keeps hearing the same advice on r/WSB: “Be like Warren Buffett and ‘BTFD’!” and “Buy when there’s blood on the streets!” After learning in Project #1 that he’ll never be able to afford a house, he’s decided to try his hand at making money in the markets. Instead on blindly picking a stock or buying the index, Joe wanted to use his financial tech skills to help him with where to look! After which Joe the average trader will run a technical breakdown of the the stock which is pulled from big boy trader accounts! Furthermore, Joe wants to use a model that will help him identify if the stock price will gho up or down. This way Joe can rely on more than his average advisor or articles recomending what he should invest in.

## **Approach**
Joe wanted up to date fresh news to find what stocks are being talked about. Unfortunitly, the unreliable media cannot help joe! Instead, Joe decided to use twitter. Thinking the news would arive much quicker than news articles! giving him some sort of edge over the other average joe. Joe however didnt want all or any tweets! Hes not interested in hearing about a dinner date or food! He strictly means business and so he decided to grab the tweets of some big name traders instead. Having fresh tweets by traders on what stocks they were talking about, Joe started his analysis of those stocks depending on their sentiment and then used a decision tree to further identify if the stock will bounce back and make him money!  







## **Conclusion**
Joe was able to idenify the top 5 most beat down stocks from twitter. OLLI was evaluated as the best option availabe. Joe has ran the stock pick through his checks and both the TA analysis & decision tree model give him the green  light on invesrting! All Joe has to do now is sit on his hands and hopefully in six months Joe will have more money towards buying a home! (hes still sour from the first project)
